"""A freshly enrolled device must be able to reach its teammates.

This is the workflow the product advertises, and it did not work. Three
things were wrong in the same few lines, each invisible on its own:

- `_session_from` dropped `relay_url`, so the relay fallback never engaged.
- Nothing ever populated `device_keys`, so `peer pull dev_...` could not
  turn a teammate's id into the key needed to dial them.
- The error message recommended `whoami --refresh`, which renewed the
  entitlement and deliberately preserved the empty key cache.

None of the unit tests noticed, because each one tested a part that worked.
