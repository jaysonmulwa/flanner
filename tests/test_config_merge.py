"""What `flanner init` does to config files it did not write.

`.claude/settings.json` and `.mcp.json` belong to the repo, not to flanner.
Both are read, merged into, and written back — and a file that failed to
parse was read as `{}`, so the write replaced it. Every other MCP server the
repo declared, every hook, every permission setting: gone, because of a
trailing comma or because somebody was mid-edit when they ran `init`.

The cost of refusing is one integration that installs on the next run once
the file parses. The cost of the alternative is work that cannot be got
back.
