"""What `flanner login` says once it has worked.

It printed one line and stopped. Enrolling is the middle of a setup, not
the end of one: the device now has an identity and no project, and the
person most likely to be running it is somebody setting up a team for the
first time, who has the least idea what to type next.

What to say depends on what the account holds, which is why this is not a
fixed block of text. A device with no workspace access cannot join
anything yet and needs to hear about the console; a device that holds a
grant needs `init` and `join` in the repository it cares about.
