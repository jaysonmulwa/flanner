"""The workflow the front page describes, from enrolling to opening the file.

Nothing covered this end to end, and that is how a missing production call
survived: `sync_from_peer` stored verified artifacts and never turned them
into anything a person could open. Every sync test asserted
`report.accepted`, which was the number that lied — it counted artifacts
written to a table, and a plan that exists only in that table is invisible
to `flanner list`, to the web UI, and to every agent.

`materialize_version`, the function that would have made it true, was called
by exactly one test file and by no production code at all. Two green test
suites, one broken product.

So this test asserts on the file and the listing rather than on a count, and
it goes through the real surfaces: two device keys, a real signed
entitlement, an http server, and the CLI commands a person actually types.
