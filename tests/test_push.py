"""The rules that make accepting unsolicited data survivable.

The transport tests in test_peer.py prove a push crosses two devices. These
prove the limits around it, which are easier to get wrong and harder to
notice: a cap that is checked after the allocation it exists to prevent, or
a rate limit that quietly turns into a permanent ban.
