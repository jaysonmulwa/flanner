"""Knowing what flanner did, without telling anybody else.

Observability for a local tool is a different problem from observability for
a service, and the difference is not one of scale.

**Nothing is ever shipped.** The whole promise of this tool is that plan
contents stay on the machine that wrote them, so there is no aggregator, no
endpoint, and no telemetry — not as a cost decision, as the product. What
this module does is make the information *available when somebody asks*.

Three questions, three shapes:

**"Why was that slow?"** Answered by `step()`, which records where the time
went and prints a breakdown under `--verbose`. Collected always because it
costs a `perf_counter` call; printed only when asked.

**"What has the agent been doing?"** Answered by `tool_call()`. The MCP
server is the one surface where nobody is watching a terminal: an agent
calls a tool, gets a dict back, and may retry or work around a failure with
the person none the wiser. Those go to a file, because on that surface
stdout *is* the protocol and a stray print corrupts it.

**"What do I put in the bug report?"** Answered by `flanner doctor
--report`, which uses the ledger below plus the store's own state.

## What is never recorded

Plan bodies, file contents, and anything a person typed into a plan. Names,
ids, counts, durations and outcomes only. A local log is not a secret, but
it is copied into issues and pasted into chats, and the first time somebody
finds a paragraph of their design doc in one is the last time they trust
this tool with anything.
