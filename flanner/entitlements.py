"""Verifying signed entitlements and workspace capabilities (PRD §11.3, §18.3).

This module only ever *verifies*. Issuing requires the control plane's
private signing key and deliberately lives elsewhere, so a client can
confirm what it was granted without being able to grant anything.

An entitlement says who a device belongs to, what the subscription allows,
and which role its owner holds in each workspace. Peers check it locally
rather than calling the control plane on every operation (§18.3), which is
also what lets flanner keep working while the network or the control plane
is down.

Two properties matter more than the format:

- **Expiry is graded, not binary.** A device that has been offline for a
  weekend is not a security problem, so an expired entitlement stays usable
  through a defined grace window and reports that it is doing so (§11.4).
  A caller that wants strictness can still refuse anything not ``VALID``.
- **Key rotation needs overlap.** Verification takes a keyring rather than
  one key, so a new signing key can be introduced before the old one is
  retired without invalidating every entitlement in flight (§18.3).
