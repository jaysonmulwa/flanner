"""Fetching and renewing an entitlement (PRD §11.4).

Everything in this module can reach the network; nothing else below the
composition roots may import it. ``session`` holds the cache and knows
nothing of HTTP, so a command that only reads authorization cannot
accidentally acquire a network call by depending on the wrong module.

Two behaviours are deliberate.

**Refresh failure is not an error.** A cached entitlement stays usable
through its grace window, so being unable to reach the control plane
degrades team features later rather than interrupting work now. Local plan
work never depends on any of this (§18.4).

**The transport is stdlib.** Two JSON POSTs do not justify a dependency in
an MIT client that most users install only for local use.
