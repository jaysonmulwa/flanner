"""Agent integration: the guard-write hook and init-time wiring.

Two cooperating layers steer coding agents toward the flanner MCP tools:

- a managed block in the repo's CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md, plus a skill (soft:
  guidance; AGENTS.md is the cross-tool convention Codex and others read)
- a PreToolUse hook that denies raw Writes into the plan directory (hard:
  enforcement, Claude Code only). The MCP tools write through flanner's
  storage layer, not the agent's Write tool, so the correct path is never
  blocked.

`decide_write` is pure and takes a parsed payload + session so it can be
tested without stdin or a live hook.

# Saving a plan through flanner

This repo manages planning docs with flanner. Do not write them with the
Write tool; the plan directory and header are handled by the MCP tools.

1. Confirm intent. If it is ambiguous whether a markdown file is a plan
   (versus a README, changelog, or notes), ask the user before proceeding.
2. Resolve the target with `get_plan_config` and `list_projects`.
3. Create with `create_plan_file_tool(project_id, name, content)`, passing the
   markdown body WITHOUT frontmatter; the header is added for you.
4. Revise an existing plan with `update_plan_file_tool(plan_file_id, content)`,
   which bumps the version and re-hashes the content.

Never hand-write the YAML header, and never place plan files outside the
directory reported by `get_plan_config`.
