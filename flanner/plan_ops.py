"""Shared plan write-path.

`write_version` is the one place that turns a body of markdown into a stored
plan version: frontmatter, filename, save to disk, hash, version record. The
MCP server and the web UI both call it so the sequence cannot drift between
surfaces.

`record_new_version` is the locked update path: it refreshes the plan row,
picks the next free version number (skipping any number whose file already
exists on disk), writes the version, bumps ``current_version``, and commits,
all under a cross-process lock. Two MCP clients, or the MCP server and the
web UI, can therefore never write the same version number or overwrite each
other's files (PRD Phase 1: single-writer discipline).

    A workspace id sits inside the signed envelope, so joining a team cannot
    move an artifact written before the join: re-signing it under the new
    workspace would produce a different id, and the signature that made the
    old one trustworthy would no longer describe anything. Without this, a
    team that adopts flanner after six months finds their existing plans
    invisible to each other, which reads as broken rather than as a design.

    So the current head of each plan is signed afresh into the workspace,
    with **no parents**. It is a root there, deliberately:

    - Its real parent lives in a workspace nobody else can verify. Pointing
      at it would hand every peer a link they can never resolve.
    - The history is not lost. Every local artifact stays exactly as it was,
      still verifiable, still on this machine. What does not travel is the
      record of *how* the plan reached its current state.

    That is the trade, and it is the honest one: teammates get the content
    they need today, and nobody is told a lineage crossed a boundary it
    did not. A plan with no signed version yet is skipped rather than
    invented.

    Idempotent. Adopting twice does nothing the second time, because the
    head is already in the workspace.
