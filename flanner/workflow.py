"""Proposal, review, and the accepted baseline (PRD §12.5).

A plan version never carries a mutable ``draft``/``approved`` field. The
version is immutable content; its workflow state is a *projection* of signed,
append-only events. That separation is what lets the same version be reviewed
twice, keeps a rejected version verifiable, and survives peers receiving valid
events in different orders.

Three heads exist at once, and conflating them is the mistake this module
exists to prevent:

- **working head** — what someone is editing. No team authority.
- **proposal head** — an immutable version offered for review. Several may be open.
- **accepted head** — the team's baseline. This is what a plain read returns,
  and what an agent implements from.

Synchronizing a proposal therefore never advances the baseline. Only an
accepted-head transition does, and only when the policy's approvals are
present. Nothing here is decided by timestamp, arrival order, device id, or
human version number: two disconnected peers that both accept produce an
explicit conflict rather than a silent winner.
