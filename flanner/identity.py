"""Device identity.

Every installation owns an Ed25519 key pair (PRD §11.2). It signs the
artifacts this device produces, so a peer can verify who wrote a plan
version without trusting the transport that carried it, and without asking
Flanner Mesh. The private key never leaves the machine.

The device id is derived from the public key rather than assigned, so an
offline installation has a stable identity from first use and the control
plane can later map it to an account without ever minting it.

Nothing here talks to the network or the database: this module is the
foundation the artifact layer signs with.
