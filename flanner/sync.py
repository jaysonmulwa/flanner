"""Manifest exchange and verified ingest (PRD §14).

Two peers reconcile by comparing manifests: each says which artifacts it
holds, and each pulls only what it lacks. Because artifacts are immutable and
content-addressed, that comparison is a set difference with no merge logic
and no notion of "newer" to get wrong.

Everything arriving from a peer is hostile until proven otherwise. An
artifact is verified *before* it is stored, never after, and a rejection is
recorded with its reason but never with its content (§14.4). Nothing here
raises on bad input: a peer must not be able to halt a sync by sending
garbage.

Transport lives elsewhere. A peer is anything answering :class:`Peer`, so
the same rules govern a sync between two sessions in one process and a sync
across a network: :mod:`flanner.peer` supplies the latter without changing
anything here.
