"""Why the control plane said no, in a word a program can match on.

Part of the public wire format, and here rather than in the control plane
for the same reason `entitlements` is: a client has to understand what it is
told, and anything a client must understand cannot live somewhere only we
can read.

## The problem this solves

Until now a refusal carried an English sentence and nothing else. That reads
well and is useless to a program: the only way to tell "your subscription
lapsed" from "your clock is wrong" was to match on prose. So improving the
wording of any message was, strictly, a breaking change — and the wording
most worth improving is the wording that is currently confusing somebody.

A code fixes the direction of that pressure. The sentence can be rewritten
whenever it would help a person, because no program depends on it.

## The rules

**A code is permanent.** It may be deprecated and it may stop being sent,
but it must never be reused to mean something else. A client from two years
ago that still matches on it must not be wrong.

**A code says what happened, not what to do.** `SUBSCRIPTION_INACTIVE`, not
`GO_AND_PAY`: the advice depends on who is asking, and the client is better
placed to decide that than we are.

**Unknown codes are normal.** A newer control plane will send codes an older
client has never heard of, so every consumer must have a path for "I do not
recognise this" that falls back to the message. `UNKNOWN` exists to be that
path's value and is never sent over the wire.
