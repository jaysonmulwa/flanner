"""Carrying peer requests over iroh, so neither device needs to be reachable.

:mod:`flanner.peer` speaks to whatever address it is given, which assumes a
route already exists between two machines. On a home connection behind NAT,
one usually does not. This supplies the route.

**Why this and not a mesh provider.** A VPN client presents a virtual network
adapter, which needs administrator rights on every operating system. That is
a separate installation the user must perform, and on a locked-down machine
cannot. iroh is a library: it opens a UDP socket, punches through NAT inside
the QUIC connection, and falls back to a relay when that fails. It arrives
with ``pip install`` and asks for nothing.

**The identity is the same key, not a second one.** An iroh endpoint id *is*
an Ed25519 public key, and so is a flanner device identity. The same 32
bytes serve as both, so this module introduces no new identity, no mapping
table, and nothing that can disagree with itself.

That is convenient, and it is also a trap worth naming. Connecting proves
the far side holds a private key. It does not prove that device may read
this workspace, which is a question only a signed entitlement answers. So
every request still goes through :func:`flanner.peer.serve_request`
unchanged, and this module decides nothing about access.

**Dialling needs the key, not the device id.** A device id is a hash of the
public key, and a hash cannot be dialled. The full key comes from the
organization keyring cached at login, via ``Session.resolve_device_key``, so
a device that was never in the directory cannot be dialled at all.
