"""Who may act in this project, and on whose authority (PRD §11.3).

One question, answered in one place, because the review surface and the
assurance verdict must not disagree about it. If they did, an approval
recorded through one would look unauthorized to the other.

There are two regimes and the difference is visible in the answer:

**Solo.** No entitlement, or a project that has not joined a workspace.
Roles come from ``workflow.local_roles()``, which answers maintainer for
everyone. Review still runs, but it gates nothing: it is a rehearsal of the
workflow, not an authorization check, and pretending otherwise would be
worse than admitting it.

**Joined.** The project names a control-plane workspace and this device
holds a usable entitlement. Roles come from the signed capability, which
cannot be self-assigned.

The failure direction matters more than either regime. Once a project has
joined a workspace, a missing, expired, or unverifiable entitlement yields
an empty role map, never the local placeholder. Falling back would mean an
expired entitlement granted strictly more than a valid one, which is the
one way this could be worse than having no authorization at all.

Nothing here reaches the network. It reads the cached entitlement through
``session``, which has no HTTP in it, so a read command stays a read.
Renewal is ``account``'s job and belongs to commands that expect to wait.
