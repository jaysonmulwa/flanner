"""Syncing with another device over the network (PRD §14).

``sync`` defines the protocol and left the transport out on purpose. This
fills it in: a handler that answers for this device's catalog, and a
:class:`Peer` implementation that talks to another device's.

Both halves live here because they are two ends of one wire format. Putting
them in separate modules is how the two drift.

**Carriers are interchangeable, access rules are not.** HTTP is built in
here because it needs nothing beyond the standard library;
:mod:`flanner.peer_iroh` adds one that works when neither device is
reachable. Both hand every request to :func:`serve_request`, so there is
exactly one place that decides who may read what.

**What authorises a peer.** Two proofs, and neither involves asking the
control plane at the time of the request:

1. *You hold this device's key.* A device id is the hash of its public key,
   so a caller that sends a public key which hashes to the id it claims has
   proved the two belong together, and the signature over the request
   proves it holds the private half. No key registry is needed for this.
2. *That device may read this workspace.* The caller sends its entitlement,
   which the control plane signed and which names both the device id and
   the workspace role. The ids in the two proofs must match, so an
   entitlement is useless to anyone who did not receive it.

The entitlement must also carry the team-sync feature. A role alone says
which workspace, not whether syncing was paid for, and checking only the
role would leave a lapsed subscription syncing exactly as before.

Together those mean a peer can authorise a stranger while completely
offline, which is the property that makes a mesh worth having.

**What is still checked afterwards.** Authorisation is not verification.
Every artifact received is checked against its *author's* key, which is
usually a third device, using the organization keyring cached at login.
A peer you trust to talk to is not a peer you trust to be honest about
what someone else wrote (§14.4).

**What this is not.** There is no private addressing here. This speaks to
whatever address it is given, so it works over a LAN, a tunnel, or a mesh
provider's network without changing. Providing a route is a transport's
job, and deliberately not this module's.
