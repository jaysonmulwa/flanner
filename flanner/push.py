"""Receiving artifacts a peer sends without being asked.

Pull answers a question. Push accepts data, which is a genuinely wider
surface, so the rules that make it safe are gathered here rather than
scattered through the transport.

Three of them matter:

**The sender is not the author.** A pushed artifact is verified against the
author's key from the organisation keyring, exactly as on pull. A hostile
peer may offer whatever it likes; anything it did not legitimately receive
fails verification and is dropped. Push changes who starts the exchange, not
who is believed.

**The role has to cover what was sent.** Reading a workspace and writing to
it are different permissions. A `READER` who pushes a plan version is
refused per artifact, not per request, so one over-reaching item in a batch
does not discard the rest.

**A live entitlement, not merely a usable one.** Elsewhere an expired
entitlement stays usable through a grace window, because punishing somebody
for a weekend offline is not security. That reasoning does not reach here:
a device serving a push request is online by definition, so it cannot claim
it was unable to check. Requiring `VALID` cuts the window in which a
revoked device can still write from the grace period plus a lifetime — over
a week — down to at most one entitlement lifetime.

    a reachability test asserts that no read path can reach ``account``, and
