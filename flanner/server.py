    Check whether a plan is safe to implement, and say exactly what it is.

    Answers the four questions an agent should settle before writing code:
    which exact artifact it would build from, which code revision that plan
    was written against, whether the plan still matches the code, and
    whether anyone approved it. Cite artifact_id in the work you produce.

    Read safe_to_implement first. When it is false, blockers says why, and
    the plan must not be implemented without resolving them; warnings are
    concerns to surface to the user rather than reasons to stop.

    capability decided the review, so an approval is one. "local" means the
    project has not joined a workspace and roles came from a map anyone
    holding the machine can edit, so reviewed and accepted_artifact_id
