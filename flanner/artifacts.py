"""Immutable signed artifacts and their lineage (PRD §12).

An artifact is a typed, immutable payload plus a signed envelope. Identity is
cryptographic, not positional: the artifact id is a hash over the canonical
envelope, so two devices that independently produce the same content produce
the same id, and any alteration produces a different one.

Three separate checks make an artifact trustworthy, and they are deliberately
independent (PRD §12.2):

- the **artifact id** must equal the hash of the envelope it claims to describe
- the **signature** must be the actor device's, over those same bytes
- the **content hash** must match the payload actually delivered

Timestamps are descriptive. They never establish order: ordering comes from
the parent links alone, so a peer with a wrong clock, or a hostile one, cannot
reorder history (PRD §12.2, §12.3).
